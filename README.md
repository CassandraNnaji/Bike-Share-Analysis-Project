# Bike-Share-Analysis-Project

# Overview
Cyclistic, a prominent bike-sharing company located in Chicago, boasts over 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations across the city. The objective of this project is to analyze historical data to discern patterns in the usage behaviors of annual and casual riders. By understanding these distinctions, we aim to formulate recommendations on converting casual riders into annual members. Additionally, we seek to propose strategies for the marketing team to leverage digital media in enticing casual riders to transition into members

# Business Understanding
The primary stakeholders for this project include Lily Moreno, the Director of Marketing, who will oversee the implementation of recommendations; the Cyclistic executive team, responsible for approving the proposed strategies based on the analysis; and the marketing team, who will execute the recommended initiatives. The team seeks various strategies to utilize digital media effectively in enticing casual riders to transition into members.

# Data Understanding
The data utilized was provided by Motivate International Inc. It encompasses 12 months of Cyclistic trip data, spanning quarters 2, 3, and 4 of 2019, as well as quarter 1 of 2020.

- Analysis: The graph illustrates that "members" consistently take more trips per day compared to "casual" users. Additionally, "casual" users exhibit a spike in rides over the weekend, whereas "members" peak on Tuesday and Wednesday


# Conclusion 
- During the winter months (Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb), ride numbers understandably decrease due to colder weather, making biking less ideal. To incentivize casual riders during this period, I recommend offering discounted memberships, ensuring they're set for increased bike usage once warmer months arrive.

- Given that casual riders tend to have longer trip durations, targeted ads and promotions can be designed to appeal to this demographic, encouraging them to take advantage of Cyclistic services.

- Focusing on the top 3 start stations—'Streeter Dr & Grand Ave', 'Canal St & Adams St', and 'Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St'—membership promotions can be strategically implemented to attract more users.

- To boost trip numbers during weekdays, attractive promotions can be crafted specifically for casual users, enticing them to utilize Cyclistic services more frequently.
